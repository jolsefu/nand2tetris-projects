<h1 align="center">NAND2TETRIS PROJECT</h1>

## Introduction
This project is from the free online course located in coursera. 
[Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course).](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
This course starts from defining a single *NAND Chip* to building a computer that runs a game like tetris.
There are 8 modules in total in this course. The modules are:
1. Introduction
2. Boolean Functions and Gate Logic
3. General Course Information
4. Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU
5. Memory
6. Machine Language
7. Computer Architecture
8. Assembler

## Project Directories
### 1/ - *Boolean Logic Chips*
